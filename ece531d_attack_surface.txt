HW: Attack Surface Write Up

So far in this class, I've written two separate but related applications.

The ece531.c program using libcurl is dependant on some amount of user input
from the command line.  Because of this, I chose not to use dynamic allocation
of memory for the various buffers strewn about the code.  Static arrays are
a very primitive way to keep certain types of user input from overflowing into
unallocated memory.

The remote web server being accessed by this program could return malicious
files and responses to the pretty naive and inexperienced mechanisms that were
implemented in this code.  Some errors are being processed, but the actual
returned data is not being examined in any meaningful manner.

The ece531d.c program that was written to explore daemons and stand alone
server process does allow for user innput, but currently ignores what it
is given in main().  

In order to log the time and date, I used the gettimeofday() function call
which depends on the dynamic linker providing me the correct version and 
symbols for this library.  It might be possible for someone to maliciously 
link in a different system call with the same symbol names to cause execution
of this application to behave incorrectly.  In order to bypass this, I have
changed compilation to be static.  It increases the size of the binary, but 
makes it less likely that this applicaitno would execute poorly on a 
unknown system.

The logging functions were also used via dynamic linking.  Changing this
to static means that the install target must support the syslog methods
that are implemented by the linked library.  Since we control the target
deployment platform, this shouldn't be an issue.

However, this increased the size of the deployed binary quite a bit.
